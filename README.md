# Face Recognition Using DeepFace

This project is a face recognition system built using the DeepFace deep learning framework. It is designed to identify three individuals(two of them are my friends) using a custom image dataset with high accuracy. The system uses pre-trained face embeddings provided by DeepFace, eliminating the need for training a model from scratch.

## 📌 Project Overview

Face recognition is a key application of computer vision and artificial intelligence. This project demonstrates a practical implementation of face recognition using:
- A custom dataset of three individuals
- The DeepFace library for facial embeddings
- Python and OpenCV for image processing

The objective of this project is to accurately detect and recognize faces from unseen images.
